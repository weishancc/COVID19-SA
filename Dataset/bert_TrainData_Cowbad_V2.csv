It is real. It will sadly kill many we love. It will destroy world economies. It will be a war on humanity like we have neve seen before.,0
It will be something that will be talked about for hundreds of years. And you. You have a choice. ,2
You have a choice to decide WHO YOU ARE. You can stress out. Worry your kids. Lose your cool. You can watch the news constantly and criticize the government. You can scramble and grab 20 packages of toilet paper because we all know that will save you. You can even cry and hide in a corner. But thats not you. THATS.NOT.YOU. ,2
The facts are its coming. You have a DIFFERENT choice. You can stay calm. You can accept that social distancing works and keep your family inside and only go out when necessary. ,1
You can avoid the media when you can and focus on what matters. Family time. Together time. Good sleep. Exercise. Eat healthy. ,2

Some of the greatest things in life are on the other side of fear. Dont get me wrong. Danger is real. There are so many things. Everyday. ,0
That can make you sick. Or even take your life. But living in fear. Fear of death. Fear of failure. Fear of success. Fear of love. Fear of heartbreak. Fear of a virus. Living in fear is limiting. It keeps us from the best parts of life. ,2
It stops us from truly fully living. Stay calm my friends. Love you all.,2

"Perspective Make yourself aware that the curve will flatten. There will be a time after Corona and if we all act responsibly this time will rather come sooner than later. Companies start adjusting by sending their workforce to home office. . Prepare for the time after Once you realize that there is light at the end of the tunnel and you have done all you can for the organization to survive this pandemic, you can start preparing for the time after.",1
"How can you use the crisis to align your values with your message (branding), optimize your product/service and bind your people to the organization? . Take care of your people Your employees will carry you through these uncertain times and they will also help you come back stronger after the crisis.",2
Is it too much asked to be a leader in this crisis who puts his/her people first? One simple way would be weekly surveys. How do they feel? Has the organization provided all needed for them to work at home as efficiently and productive as at the workplace? Does the communication within the team work? Do employees get the same support by their direct manager as before? Does the company provide enough information for the employee to feel safe? Are there processes in place for different teams to communicate with each other? And so on...,1
